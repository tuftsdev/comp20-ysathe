Thanks to TA Toby! (Glover) for introducing me to the .ready function,(a function i later realised had been staring me in the face the whole time), something without which i would have pretty much stayed on the bench, this entire lab.


wow Iâ€™m finally done the log works exactly as it should.

i figured out a way that atleast i think is clever, to show the stored messages in reverse order without the use of arrays. like it was the dumbest thing, i almost think i cheated myself out of being able to learn how to solve that issue with the use of data structures.

meh.

enjoy.

I have borrowed a lot of lines of code from the local storage example up on the courses GitHub page. because why reinvent the wheel right? 

how many hours did this take? 7-8

oh I dont know lets say an embarrassingly large amount. maybe 7 cause morning office hours another 1, today evening like 3 and yesterday evening like 3. yeah 7 seems about right.
