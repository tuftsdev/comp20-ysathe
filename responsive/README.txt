This is the readme file for lab 4.
this has crossed the 2 hour point, work-wise.
faced issues with pushing into the repo identical to the one somebody posted on piazza about with the error 
“fatal: the current branch master has no upstream branch to push the current branch, and set remote as upstream, use 

git push —set -upstream origin master 

needed to configure ssh which took forever
thanks to (TA) Joe Campbell for helping with the configuration!
